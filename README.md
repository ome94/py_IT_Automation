# UNIT TESTING
This is a mini repo / codebase I created to **test** myself out on some new concepts I learned from tht Testing with pthon module of the Google IT Automtion with Python course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org)

I first stated out writing the code for an operation as simple as adding, then I started coming up with more ideas for optimizations such as:
- adding more parameters,
- filtering out other data types which aren't `int`s
- include `list`s whose element's are `int`s
- and many more (check [add.py](./add.py))

A some point I got lazy writing out the code because I needed to get back to my lessons(I borrowed the phone I'm using to access the lessons), so I wrote black-box tests for what I expect. I should get back at the code very soon.

Check out my [unit test code](./add_test.py)
